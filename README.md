# click-the-cat
This is a toy web-app I wrote to flex my web developments skills.

It's easy to use:
Choose a cat; increase it's click count by clicking on its image.
Edit any cats data by pressing on the red 'Admin' button.

This web-app is front-end only. 
It uses a bootstrap responsive layout for the look, JQuery for the DOM manipulation, 
jQuery Validation for the form validation and was written in an MVC style without an 
organisational library.
