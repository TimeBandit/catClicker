# click-the-cat
This is a toy web-app I wrote to flex my web developments skills.
Choose a cat; increase it's click count by clicking on its image.
Edit any cats data by pressing on the red 'Admin' button.
This web-app is front-end only. It uses a bootstrap responsive layout for the look, 
JQuery for the DOM manipulation and was written in an MVC style.
